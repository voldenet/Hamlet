*NARRATOR A platform before the castle. Francisco at his post.
>BERNARDO
BERNARDO Who's there?
FRANCISCO Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO Long live the king!
FRANCISCO Bernardo?
BERNARDO He.
FRANCISCO You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
FRANCISCO And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO Well, good night.
BERNARDO If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
BERNARDO The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
>HORATIO
>MARCELLUS
HORATIO Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO Give you good night.
MARCELLUS O, farewell, honest soldier:
MARCELLUS Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO Bernardo has my place.
MARCELLUS Give you good night.
<FRANCISCO
MARCELLUS Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO Say,
BERNARDO What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO A piece of him.
BERNARDO Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
MARCELLUS And will not let belief take hold of him
MARCELLUS Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
MARCELLUS Therefore I have entreated him along
MARCELLUS With us to watch the minutes of this night;
MARCELLUS That if again this apparition come,
MARCELLUS He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO Sit down awhile;
BERNARDO And let us once again assail your ears,
BERNARDO That are so fortified against our story
BERNARDO What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO Well, sit we down,
HORATIO And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO Last night of all,
BERNARDO When yond same star that's westward from the pole
BERNARDO Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
BERNARDO Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
BERNARDO The bell then beating one,--
>GHOST
MARCELLUS Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
HORATIO Together with that fair and warlike form
HORATIO In which the majesty of buried Denmark
HORATIO Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS It is offended.
BERNARDO See, it stalks away!
HORATIO Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
<GHOST
MARCELLUS 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
BERNARDO Is not this something more than fantasy?
BERNARDO What think you on't?
HORATIO Before my God, I might not this believe
HORATIO Without the sensible and true avouch
HORATIO Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS Is it not like the king?
HORATIO As thou art to thyself:
HORATIO Such was the very armour he had on
HORATIO When he the ambitious Norway combated;
HORATIO So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
HORATIO He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
HORATIO 'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
MARCELLUS With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not;
HORATIO But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
HORATIO This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
MARCELLUS Why this same strict and most observant watch
MARCELLUS So nightly toils the subject of the land,
MARCELLUS And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
MARCELLUS And foreign mart for implements of war;
MARCELLUS Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
MARCELLUS Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
MARCELLUS What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
MARCELLUS Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
MARCELLUS Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO That can I;
HORATIO At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
HORATIO Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
HORATIO Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
HORATIO Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
HORATIO Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
HORATIO For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
HORATIO Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
HORATIO Well ratified by law and heraldry,
HORATIO Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
HORATIO Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
HORATIO Against the which, a moiety competent
HORATIO Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
HORATIO To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
HORATIO Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
HORATIO And carriage of the article design'd,
HORATIO His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
HORATIO Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
HORATIO Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
HORATIO Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
HORATIO For food and diet, to some enterprise
HORATIO That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
HORATIO As it doth well appear unto our state--
HORATIO But to recover of us, by strong hand
HORATIO And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
HORATIO So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
HORATIO Is the main motive of our preparations,
HORATIO The source of this our watch and the chief head
HORATIO Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO I think it be no other but e'en so:
BERNARDO Well may it sort that this portentous figure
BERNARDO Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
BERNARDO That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
HORATIO In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
HORATIO A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
HORATIO The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
HORATIO Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
HORATIO As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
HORATIO Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
HORATIO Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
HORATIO Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
HORATIO And even the like precurse of fierce events,
HORATIO As harbingers preceding still the fates
HORATIO And prologue to the omen coming on,
HORATIO Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
HORATIO Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
HORATIO But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
>GHOST
HORATIO I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
HORATIO If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
HORATIO Speak to me:
HORATIO If there be any good thing to be done,
HORATIO That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
HORATIO Speak to me:
*COCK crows
HORATIO If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
HORATIO Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
HORATIO Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
HORATIO Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
HORATIO For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
HORATIO Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO 'Tis here!
HORATIO 'Tis here!
MARCELLUS 'Tis gone!
<GHOST
MARCELLUS We do it wrong, being so majestical,
MARCELLUS To offer it the show of violence;
MARCELLUS For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
MARCELLUS And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing
HORATIO Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
HORATIO The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
HORATIO Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
HORATIO Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
HORATIO Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
HORATIO The extravagant and erring spirit hies
HORATIO To his confine: and of the truth herein
HORATIO This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock.
MARCELLUS Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
MARCELLUS Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
MARCELLUS The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
MARCELLUS And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
MARCELLUS The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
MARCELLUS No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
MARCELLUS So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it.
HORATIO But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
HORATIO Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
HORATIO Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
HORATIO Let us impart what we have seen to-night
HORATIO Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
HORATIO This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
HORATIO Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
HORATIO As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
MARCELLUS Where we shall find him most conveniently.
